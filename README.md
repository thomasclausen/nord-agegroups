# Description

Simple functionality plugin that thru shortcodes allows you to show which ages bellongs in which groups.

Agegroups in danish swimming changes once every year so this little plugin simply automatically changes which ages bellongs in which groups so I don't have to update manually.

# Examples

It can be seen in action here: [http://www.svommeklubbennord.dk/konkurrenceafdeling/klubrekorder/](http://www.svommeklubbennord.dk/konkurrenceafdeling/klubrekorder/) and on it's subpages

# Usage

Download it, upload it and activate it!

The shortcode to insert looks like this:

    [agegroup group=junior gender=female]

options:

    group=aargang2 - choices: 'aargang2', 'aargang1', 'junior' or 'senior'
    gender=female - choices: 'female' or 'male'
